# Python-Data-Analysis
Welcome to my collection of data analysis projects! In this repository, you'll find a variety of projects where I've explored and analyzed datasets to derive insights and make data-driven decisions. Each project focuses on a specific topic or dataset, showcasing my skills in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and interpretation.

# Projects Overview:
1. [Elementary IMDb Data Analysis](file:///Users/jasminejordan-lake/Desktop/Elementary%20Data%20Analysis.html)
   - This data analysis project explores IMDb rating trends, frequency distributions, and their correlation with box office earnings in the   film industry. Findings reveal an evolution in movie runtimes and IMDb ratings over time, with decreasing variability in runtimes and a decline in IMDb ratings in recent years. Despite variations, a balanced mix of movie ratings is observed, with the majority clustering around the middle range. These insights offer valuable guidance for stakeholders, enabling informed decision-making in movie production, marketing strategies, and further exploration of industry dynamics.
