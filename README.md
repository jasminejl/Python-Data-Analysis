# Python-Data-Science
Welcome to my collection of data analysis projects! In this repository, you'll find a variety of projects where I've explored and analyzed datasets to derive insights and make data-driven decisions. Each project focuses on a specific topic or dataset, showcasing my skills in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and interpretation.

# Projects Overview:
1. [Elementary IMDb Data Analysis](https://github.com/jasminejl/Python-Data-Analysis/blob/main/IMDb%20Data.ipynb)
   - This data analysis project explores IMDb rating trends, frequency distributions, and their correlation with box office earnings in the   film industry. Findings reveal an evolution in movie runtimes and IMDb ratings over time, with decreasing variability in runtimes and a decline in IMDb ratings in recent years. Despite variations, a balanced mix of movie ratings is observed, with the majority clustering around the middle range. These insights offer valuable guidance for stakeholders, enabling informed decision-making in movie production, marketing strategies, and further exploration of industry dynamics.

   - The UCI Adult Census dataset (1994) serves as a valuable resource for understanding the socioeconomic landscape and analyzing the complexities of income. This dataset provides a comprehensive array of demographic attributes, offering insights into the factors influencing income levels. Our study utilizes this dataset to delve into possible predictors of income disparity and examine underlying trends.

3. [California Housing K-Means Clustering Analysis](https://github.com/jasminejl/Python-Data-Analysis/blob/main/California%20Housing%20Prices%20K-Means%20Clustering%20Analysis%20(1).ipynb)
   - This data analysis project offers a comprehensive exploration of the California housing market, unveiling nuanced spatial and socioeconomic dynamics through K-means clustering. By identifying distinct clusters and their characteristics, the analysis equips stakeholders with actionable insights to inform strategic decisions in real estate investment, urban planning, economic development, and business expansion. By leveraging these findings, stakeholders can navigate the multifaceted landscape of the California housing market with confidence, optimizing resource allocation, fostering equitable growth, and capitalizing on emerging opportunities for sustainable development and prosperity.
  
4. [Bank Marketing Persuasive Analysis](https://github.com/jasminejl/Python-Data-Analysis/blob/main/BankMarketing-2-1-2%20(1).ipynb)
   - The analysis focuses on understanding the dynamics of direct marketing campaigns within a Portuguese banking institution, using a Bank Marketing Dataset. The goal is to explore factors influencing clients' decisions to subscribe to term deposits, a critical financial product. Objectives include ensuring data accuracy, predicting subscription using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, visualizing demographic and marketing factors affecting subscription likelihood, and extracting actionable insights for strategic decisions like targeted customer segmentation and personalized marketing campaigns. The aim is to enhance customer satisfaction, drive business success, and solidify the institution's industry leadership.


5. [Intro to Data Science Final Project: IMDb Analysis](https://github.com/jasminejl/Python-Data-Analysis/blob/main/finalprojectintro.pdf)
   - In this study, we have presented findings derived from a comprehensive analysis of IMDb data, showing key trends in the film industry. “IMDb (‘Internet Movie Database’) is the world’s most popular and authoritative source for
movie, TV and celebrity content. Find ratings and reviews for the newest movie and TV shows (IMDb 2024).” Over the years, we observed a significant decrease in average IMDb ratings, accompanied by a convergence towards a narrower range of scores. Additionally, average film runtimes have also converged. Our analysis further reveals a general positive relationship between IMDb ratings and box office earnings, as well as between film runtime and IMDb ratings. Overall, this may suggest that evolving audience preferences and
changes in filmmaking practices may be influencing these trends. These findings offer valuable insights for stakeholders, suggesting optimized runtime decisions aligned with audience preferences, effective marketing strategies leveraging IMDb ratings and box office correlations, and further exploration of industry dynamics and trends.
